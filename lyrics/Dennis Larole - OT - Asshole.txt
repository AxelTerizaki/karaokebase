{48}{344}[Denis Leary - Asshole]
{452}{608}Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream.
{608}{701}About me, about you, 
{701}{775}about the way our American hearts beat 
{775}{827}way down in the bottom of our chests. 
{827}{911}About that special feeling we get 
{911}{959}in the cockles of our hearts, 
{959}{1005}maybe below the cockles, 
{1005}{1056}maybe in the subcockle area. 
{1056}{1108}Maybe in the liver. 
{1108}{1157}Maybe in the kidneys. 
{1157}{1221}Maybe even in the colon. 
{1221}{1294}We don't know...
{1324}{1487}I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.
{1487}{1619}I'm your average white suburbanite slob.
{1619}{1709}I like football and porno and books about war.
{1720}{1876}I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor.
{1876}{2003}My wife and my job, my kids and my car.
{2003}{2147}My feet on my table...and a cuban cigar.
{2190}{2310}But sometimes that just ain't enough 
{2310}{2375}to keep a man like me interested
{2375}{2439}no way 
{2439}{2562}No, I've gotta go out and have fun 
{2562}{2627}at someone else's expense
{2627}{2725}Yay, yay ! Yay yay yay ~~~~~O~~~~~
{2725}{2848}I drive really slow in the ultra-fast lane,
{2848}{2974}While people behind me are going insane.
{2974}{3100}I'm an asshole 
{3100}{3221}I'm an asshole 
{3221}{3347}I use public toilets and I piss on the seat,
{3347}{3467}I walk around in the summertime saying "How about this heat?"
{3467}{3591}I'm an asshole 
{3591}{3722}I'm an asshole 
{3722}{3850}Sometimes I park in handicapped spaces,
{3850}{3976}While handicapped people make handicapped faces.
{3976}{4095}I'm an asshole 
{4095}{4217}I'm an asshole 
{4217}{4408}Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song
{4408}{4461}Ranting and raving and carrying on
{4461}{4645}Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong...
{4667}{4719}NAAAAH!
{4719}{4837}I'm an asshole 
{4837}{4969}I'm an asshole 
{4969}{5007}Know what I'm gonna do? 
{5007}{5118}I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac El Dorado Convertible, 
{5118}{5276}hot pink, with whaleskin hubcaps and all-leather cow interior
{5276}{5352}and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights... 
{5352}{5381}YAY ! ~~~O~~~
{5381}{5472}And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour, 
{5472}{5535}getting 1 mile per gallon, 
{5535}{5581}suckin' down quarter pound cheeseburgers from McDonald's 
{5581}{5665}in the old-fashioned non-biodegradable styrofoam containers 
{5665}{5731}and when I'm done suckin' down those greaseball burgers 
{5731}{5784}I'm gonna wipe my mouth on the American Flag 
{5784}{5867}and then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam containers right out the side, 
{5867}{5964}and there ain't a goddamn thing anybody can do about it. 
{5964}{5979}You know why? 
{5979}{6029}Because we got the bombs, that's why 
{6029}{6117}Two words: Nuclear fuckin' weapons, OK? 
{6117}{6176}Russia, Germany, Romania, 
{6176}{6216}they can have all the democracy they want...
{6216}{6273}they can have a big democracy cakewalk right 
{6273}{6312}through the middle of Tienamen Square 
{6312}{6353}and it won't make a lick of difference, 
{6353}{6417}because we got the bombs, OK? 
{6417}{6485}John Wayne's not dead, he's frozen! 
{6485}{6538}And as soon as we find a cure for cancer, 
{6538}{6570}we're gonna thaw out the Duke 
{6570}{6608}and he's gonna be pretty pissed off. 
{6608}{6626}You know why? 
{6626}{6669}Have you ever taken a cold shower? 
{6669}{6729}Well, multiply that by 15 million times, 
{6729}{6776}that's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be. 
{6776}{6854}I'm gonna get the Duke and John Casavetti and Lee Marvin 
{6854}{6890}and Sam Peckinpaw 
{6890}{6920}and a case of whisky 
{6920}{6952}and drive to Texas...
{6952}{6976}(HEY, HEY HEY!>
{6976}{7030}You know you really are an asshole ?
{7030}{7082}Why don't you shut up and sing the song, pal?
{7082}{7200}I'm an asshole 
{7200}{7331}I'm an asshole 
{7331}{7439}A S-S H-O L-E
{7439}{7564}Everybody, A S-S H-O L-E
{7564}{7695}Arf, Arf Arf, Arf Arf, Arf Arf
{7695}{7819}Thoomph A-thoom-thoom A-thoom-thoom A-thoom-thoom
{7819}{7934}Oooooooo
{7934}{8056}I'm an asshole, and I'm proud of it.
